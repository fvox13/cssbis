CSSbis Useful CSS Mini-Framework

You know how it is.  You make websites.  You make web applications.  There's a lot of repeated code amongst these, especially CSS, because you have a style, you know what you like, and there's some stuff that a lot of websites have in common.  What's more, when you change jobs, you have to reinvent a lot of boilerplate, unnecessarily.

"Bis" is a musical term (did I mention that's what my degree is in?) that means "repeat" or "twice" or "again".  I got tired of repeating myself all the time, so I thought I'd stick some useful CSS styles up on github for myself to use, or for you to use, if you find them useful...
