CSSbis Useful CSS Mini-Framework
by Steven L Smith

You know how it is.  You make websites.  You make web applications.  There's a lot of repeated code amongst these, especially CSS, because you have a style, you know what you like, and there's some stuff that a lot of websites have in common.  What's more, when you change jobs, you have to reinvent a lot of boilerplate, unnecessarily.

"Bis" is a musical term (did I mention that's what my degree is in?) that means "repeat" or "twice" or "again".  I got tired of repeating myself all the time, so I thought I'd stick some useful CSS styles up on github for myself to use, or for you to use, if you find them useful...

Preview Styles by cloning this repo, and viewing demo.html in the _demo directory, or on htmlpreview.github.io below:
